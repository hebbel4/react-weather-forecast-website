## Weather Forecast Website

* This web app allows you to get weather forecast for 5 days of the city you specified. (Made Ajax requests with Axios(return a promise), applied Redux-Promise as middleware(gate-keeper) to handle the promise returned from action creator and send resolved action to reducers, and the API used is OpenWeatherMap)
* You can get an idea of temperature, pressure, and humidity displayed as chart (Used Sparkline package of react)
* Shows a Google Map window of the city to let user get a more interactive feel to it
